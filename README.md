A Mac screensaver that simulates a sky. It uses your computer's location and date to calculate the sunrise & sunset. During the day, you'll see a beautiful blue sky with light, fluffy clouds floating by.  At night, a deep, dark sky will take over with twinkling stars brightening your evening. Around sunrise & sunset, you'll see a gorgeous transition that abstractly simulates gradients of colors that you might see on your own during these times of day.

## Development
After you clone the repo, open the `SkySaver.xcodeproj` project in Xcode. The schemes offer an option for previewing the screensaver in a basic shell application, which is helpful for development & debugging live with Xcode; the other option is to build the screensaver itself, which will build to the `Products` directory in the project. You can open that to install it on your Mac (one easy way to do that is to ctrl-click on the `Sky.saver` file, and select "Open with external editor").

## Prerequisites
Sky is available on macOS 10.15®+ (Big Sur® & Catalina®).
